# ModelMediation

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ModelMediation is to facilitate estimation and uncertainty quantification for mediation effects in model based mediation analysis.

Here is an outline of what is left to do: 

* Build validation dataset
  + Generate data in a way that can be recycled for parametric bootstrap
* Run bootstrap
  + Parametric bootstrap
  + Non-parametric bootstrap
* Construct CIs from bootstrap output
  + Decide on standard output for previous step
  + Percentile
  + Basic
  + ~~Wald (parametric only)~~ (see note below)<!-- ~~ indicates strikethrough. This is a markdown comment -->
  + Bias Corrected?
  
For now, I'm going to omit the Wald interval. I think it will be better to keep parametric and non-parametric as similar as possible and introduce any differences later.

Important Note: The issues I've had with incompatible country order should be fixed if I sort the data by country before doing any analysis.


## Installation

You can install the development version of ModelMediation from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wruth1/ModelMediation")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ModelMediation)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
